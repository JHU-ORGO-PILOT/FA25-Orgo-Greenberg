## PILOT Information

- PILOT is a loose acronym for peer-led-team learning. In the PILOT program, students are organized into study teams of six to ten members who meet weekly to work problems together. A trained student leader acts as captain and facilitates the meetings.
- PILOT aims to help students make a smooth transition to college life both academically and socially. More importantly, PILOT aims to actively teach and demonstrate how collaborative learning uses contributions from individuals to benefit a group.
  - For more information about PILOT at Hopkins, please visit its [webpage](https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/pilot/).
